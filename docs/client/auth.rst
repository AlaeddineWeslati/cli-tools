Auth client
===========

It creates a file .senslabrc in your home directory with your credentials. When you use
other command-line clients without authentication options they try to read this file and use 
your credentials.

	``$ auth-cli -u <login> -p <password>``	

        with password prompt :	
        
	``$ auth-cli -u <login>``
